/*
  Touch Range to PWM Range

  Maps capacitance on touch pin T2 to an audible tone frequency. You first need 
  to figure out what the touch value range is by touching/squeezing/stretching and releasing 
  the touch pin and reading the values in the serial monitor. Change 
  the threshold accordingly.
  
  Connect + of the speaker to pin D0
  Connect - of the speaker to GND
  Connect a touch sensor to pin T2 (with an alligator clip for example)
