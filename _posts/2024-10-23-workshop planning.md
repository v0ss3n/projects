# Introduction

------------------------------------

## Workshop planning

Workshop day 1 | 13:00-17:00
--- | ---
13:00-13:15 | Walk in, welcome
13:15-13:45 | Introduction & presentation (examples of possible inputs/outputs, wearable fabrication techniques, interactions)
13:45-14:15 | Ideation, brainstorming, sketching
14:15-15:00 | Electronics & Arduino programming crash course focusing on your wishes. If you know electronics/programming already: get started!
15:00-15:15 | Break
15:15-16:45 | Prototyping circuits and (parts of) the wearable work of art
16:45-17:00 | Show & tell, clean up

Workshop day 2 | 13:00-17:00
--- | ---
13:00-13:15 | Walk in, welcome, what do you need to get started?
13:15-15:00 | Working on bringing the wearable art to life: bringing electronics & shapes together, making it wearable, integrating the circuit
15:00-15:15 | Break
15:15-16:30 | Finalizing prototypes: testing, troubleshooting, finishing touches 
16:30-17:00 | Wearable art show! Documenting results & reflecting on the process

Learning goal | How
--- | ---
Designing wearable things in 3D | Prototyping with various available materials and 3D techniques
Making electronics wearable | Integrating electronic circuits, using portable power options
Programming basics in Arduino IDE | Arduino IDE crash course - walkthrough for beginners
Basics of electronics | 'Sketching in hardware': prototyping electronics and learning by doing, trying out different inputs/outputs or deep diving into one


End of day 1 goals: 
- a clear idea for a wearable
- parts of the wearable without electronics done
- working programmed electronics (doesn't have to be wireless, soldered or final yet, just a first working iteration)  

End of day 2 goals:
- Working electronics
- Making electronics wearable (starting together with this)
